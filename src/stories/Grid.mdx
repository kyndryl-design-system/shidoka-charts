# Grid

Examples of usage within the Foundation Grid. It is recommended to use a constant aspect ratio for all charts within a grid row, or a fixed height for all charts within a grid.

The examples below use custom aspect ratios per-row, and you can use the controls within each story to experiment with fixed height.
